# ZinKedin, a Linkedin service on web 3.0

ZinKedin is a Dapp and it's similar to "Linkedin" in web2. However, ZinKedin possesses several advantages. For example, it protects user data with ZK proof from leaking to others who doesn't be permitted. Furthermore, it can also save some time for company HR, because it can utilize Unirep to automatically select CV with simple conditions.
Moreover, the experience user claim they have can finally get verified on our DappÔºÅ
We will provide a service which can support Certification issuer and Company deploy their own NFT certificate, the Web3 immutable Certificate. There are more technical detail we want to share with participants. Thank for holding this event.

## Abstractions about how it works

1. First, job seeker creates CV through `CV_Template` contract, which can be verified by... let's say ex-company. Relatively, company issues several hiring informations, incuding job title and several discriptions through `Vacancy_Template` contract.

2. Then, job seekers can search for job vacancies and chooose which job he or she wants to apply for. Company will then recieve CV.

3. At last, Companies tell the job seeker whether he or she is admited or not.
